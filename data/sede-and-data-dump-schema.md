**Markdown taken from [Database schema documentation for the public data dump and SEDE](https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/2678), 2025-03-01.**

**About this list:**  
-  **foreign key** fields are formatted as [links](https://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/query/472607?table=posts) to their parent table  
- *italic* table names are found in **both** the Data Dump on [Archive.org](https://archive.org/download/stackexchange) as well as in the [SEDE](https://data.stackexchange.com/)  
- if a column is optional or nullable, when it is NULL, it won't appear as an attribute in data dump / `<row ...>`.

Timestamps
=
All timestamps are [**`UTC`**][1], default format: `yyyy-MM-dd hh:mm:ss.fff` (stored with three digits of millisecond precision as implemented by SQL Server, making the "end" of a day `23:59:59.997`).  

**Example of conversion** current time to `PST` (including [DST][2]) using [`At Time Zone`][3]:  

<!-- language: lang-sql -->
    SELECT GetDate() At Time Zone 'UTC' At Time Zone 'Pacific Standard Time';

<sub>The time zones do not have great names, as they imply that you would have to use `'Pacific Daylight Time'` and know something about DST. To list **available time zones**: `SELECT * FROM sys.time_zone_info`</sub>
